## Load benchmarking library
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
library(lpSolveAPI)
library(Benchmarking)
```

## Set up data as input and output vectors for benchmarking
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(150,400,320,520,350,320,0.2,0.7,1.2,2,1.2,0.7),ncol = 2)
y <- matrix(c(14000,14000,42000,28000,19000,14000,3500,21000,10500,42000,25000,15000),ncol = 2)
colnames(y) <- c("reimbursed","private_paid")
colnames(x) <- c("staff_hours","supplies")

## Run DEA analysis using CRS
```{r}
d1 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "crs")
d1

```


## Peers and lamda for CRS
```{r}
peers(d1)
lambda(d1)

```



## Run DEA analysis using FDH
```{r}
d2 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "fdh")
d2

```


## Peers and lamda for FDH
```{r}
peers(d2)
lambda(d2)

```



## Run DEA analysis using VRS
```{r}
d3 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "vrs")
d3

```


## Peers and lamda for VRS
```{r}
peers(d3)
lambda(d3)

```


## Run DEA analysis using IRS
```{r}
d4 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "irs")
d4

```



## Peers and lamda for IRS
```{r}
peers(d4)
lambda(d4)

```





## Run DEA analysis using DRS
```{r}
d5 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "drs")
d5

```


## Peers and lamda for DRS
```{r}
peers(d5)
lambda(d5)

```





## Run DEA analysis using FRH
```{r}
d6 <- dea(x,y,RTS = "add")
d6

```


## Peers and lamda for FRH
```{r}
peers(d6)
lambda(d6)

```



# Tabular Summary of the Peers and Lambda results for different DEA model assumptions

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\scarb\\OneDrive\\KSU\\Quantitative Modelling\\Assignments\\DEA_Summary.jpg")

```

## Results across all different DEA assumptions are the same for Facilities 1-4, thus they are efficient across all modeling assumptions.  However, Facility 6 is not effient for all except the FRH assumption and Facility 5 is not efficient for CRS and DRS assumptions of the DEA model.



## The FDH and FRH assumptions results in all facilities being efficient because neither applies the convexity assumption, which connects facilities 1-4 in all but the VRS and IRS  model assumptions.  The VRS and IRS model assumptions also include Facility 5 as efficient.
